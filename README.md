# About

I started learning Rust recently following the [Brown's Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/). So, I thought to create this repository where I will post all my side-projects aiming to solidify my knowledge about this programming language. 

I strongly believe that a way to grasp knowledge is through deliberate practice, where I will read chapters, mix everything and think about something I want to do.

**Note: All code here is not meant to be used in production, it's all for learning purposes.**  

## First Project (Simple Calculator)

I did a simple four operation calculator using the knowledge obtained from chapter 1-3 and a I little research as well. 

1. Project Design
- User inputs the operation he wants to do: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Get the user to one of the four if branches.
- Then perform the operation and output the correct result.

2. Code
